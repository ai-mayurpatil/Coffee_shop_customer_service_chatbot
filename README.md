# Coffee Shop Customer Service Chatbot 
Welcome to the Coffee Shop Customer Service Chatbot project! This repository contains code, resources, and instructions for an AI-powered chatbot that enhances customer experiences in a coffee shop app. Using LLMs, NLP, and RunPod, it assists with orders, menu queries, and personalized recommendations in a React Native app.

# ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a smart, **agent-based chatbot** that can:
* Handle real-time customer interactions with the chatbot including orders.
* Answer questions about menu items, including ingredients and allergens through a **Retreival augmented Generation (RAG) system**.
* Provide personalized product recommendations through a **market basket analysis recommendation engine**.
* Guide customers through a seamless order process, ensuring accurate and structured order details.
* Block irrelevant or harmful queries using a Guard Agent for safe and relevant interactions.

## ðŸ”§ What You Learn
Through this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:
* Deploying your personal LLM with RunPod
* Deploying an agent-based system with specialized agents like Order Taking, Details, and Guard agents.
* Setting up a vector database for storing coffee shop menu and product information.
* Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for detailed and accurate responses.
* Training and deploying a recommendation engine.
* Building a React Native app that integrates this powerful chatbot.

### ðŸ¤– Key Agents in the System:
1. **Guard Agent:**
This agent acts as the first line of defense. It monitors all incoming user queries and ensures that only relevant and safe messages are processed by the other agents. It blocks inappropriate, harmful, or irrelevant queries, protecting the system and ensuring smooth conversations with users.
2. **Order Taking Agent:**
This agent is responsible for guiding customers through the order placement process. It uses chain-of-thought prompt engineering to simulate human-like reasoning, ensuring the order is accurately structured and all customer preferences are captured. It ensures that the chatbot gathers all necessary order details in a logical, step-by-step process, enhancing the reliability of the final order.
3. **Details Agent (RAG System):**
Powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, the Details Agent answers specific customer questions about the coffee shop, including menu details, ingredients, allergens, and other frequently asked questions. It retrieves relevant data stored in the vector database and combines it with language generation capabilities to provide clear and precise responses.
4. **Recommendation Agent:**
This agent handles personalized product recommendations by working with the market basket recommendation engine. Triggered by the Order Taking Agent, it analyzes the user's current order or preferences and suggests complementary items. This agent aims to boost upselling opportunities or help users discover new products they might like.
5. **Classification Agent:**
This is the decision-making agent. It classifies incoming user queries and determines which agent is best suited to handle the task. By categorizing user intents, it ensures that queries are routed efficiently, whether the user is asking for recommendations, placing an order, or inquiring about specific menu details.
